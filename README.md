# ReactReduxTemplate

This is the repository for modern javascript template that is written in [JavaScript Stack from Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/blob/master/README.md).
This template is made from following factors.

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [chai](http://chaijs.com/)
* [babel](https://babeljs.io/)

This does not include Production / development environments, Express, React Router, Server-Side Rendering, Styling, Enzyme, Git Hooks.
Therefore, in this time, if you use as web application template, you have to add Express and so on.

## Usage
In this time, you can see client module by following command and opening `dist/index.html`.
```
  yarn start
```

## Test
```
  yarn test
```
